# Visitor Counter

Visitor Counter is a lightweight, self-hosted web analytics tool — a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics.  
It allows you to track visits, page views, and visitor locations across multiple websites, all from your own dashboard.

## 🧩 Usage

1. On the homepage, create a **new tag** (you can create multiple for different websites).  
2. Give it a name — a **unique code** will be generated automatically.  
3. Copy the generated **HTML tracking snippet** and paste it inside the `<head>` section of your website’s code.  
4. Access your tag’s **Dashboard** to view visits, location stats, and other analytics.

> You can also integrate the tag into multiple pages using URL parameters to separate data by page.
